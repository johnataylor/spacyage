Experiments with building Bots with SpaCy

## Install Spacy

On windows:

Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment:

```cmd
python -m venv c:\env\spacyage
c:\env\spaceage\scripts\activate
```

And when inside this environment install SpaCy:

```cmd
pip install spacy
```

Then as administrator (because it needs permissions to creates a link):

```cmd
python -m spacy download en
```
